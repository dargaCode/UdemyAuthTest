# Auth Test
<strong>Language: HTML/JS+Node+Express+Passport/MongoDB</strong>

Use passport and express middleware to lock a page from the public.

Users must create a username and password before they can log in and access the page.

This was the last small project remaining in my class, and now everything else is focused on incorporating all these topics into the final project.
